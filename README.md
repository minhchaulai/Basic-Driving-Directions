# 2270project
For the final project, I’ll be doing an implementation of a travel program that calculates the shortest route between cities, given an undirected weighted graph. I’ll also attempt to use the Google Maps API to make it easy to quickly add city vertices to the graph, but if I don’t get the API working I will just add methods for the user to do so manually, but it’d be nice to just be able to enter the city and have all the necessary values automatically added. To make sure that the project is more than just an implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm, I will also be adding the A* shortest path algorithm, which factors in more variables than just distance. In addition to shortest distance, we can optimize for things like gas used and time spent in travel, so the user will have these three options to decide on an optimal route rather than just distance.
